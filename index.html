  <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>

  <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/articles/github-pages-via-web-app/happy-ice-cream.gif" />

   <h2>Who I am</h2>
   <p> I am a born and raised Arizonan that never truly has aclimated to the insane heat that comes with living here.</p>
   <p> I love going to concerts and binge watching anything from first responder shows to scary movies.</p>
   <p>For a great portion of my working career I was a Barista and mastered the art of coffee. <br> Till this day I have the passion for creating the perfect drink for people but I myself cannot drink much coffee anymore.</p>
   <p> In this website my intentions are to show the interpersonal side of myself as a way to also show my coding skills at the same time.<br> Since when it comes down to it I am passionate about many things but everyone is always suprised I am seeking a coding based career.</p>
   <p>However, the more you know about me the more it shows why coding is so intriguing to a person like me who could be the worlds most introverted peoples person.</p>
