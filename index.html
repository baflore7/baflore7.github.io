   <h2>Who I am</h2>
   <p> I am a born and raised Arizonan that never truly has aclimated to the insane heat that comes with living here.</p>
   <p> I love going to concerts and binge watching anything from first responder shows to scary movies.</p>
   <p>For a great portion of my working career I was a Barista and mastered the art of coffee. Till this day I have the passion for creating the perfect drink for people but I myself cannot drink much coffee anymore.</p>
