   <h2>The Generations of Dogs I have had:</h2>
   <h1>Childhood Dogs</h1>
   <p>During my childhood into my teen years, I was not the most social or most popular at school but I knew I had the best of friends at home waiting for me.</p>
   <p>When I was around 9 years old and never had a dog as small as my first Chihuahua that we adopted on Thanksgiving in 2008. She came with the name Linda but had the cutest apple head ever!</p>
   <p>She was a year old at the time but seemed very scared until she became use to my mom and I. However, of course being a little kid who was an outcast at school was ethralled by the fact I had someone who actually wanted to hang out with me, so I ended up asking for another one a year later.</p>
   <p>That is when my mom and I were at the 99 cent store and saw someone selling a litter of white Chihuahuas and they ended up having one girl pup. Therefore, as one little kid does; I started begging for her and of course at some point my mom gave in and we took her home to Linda.</p>
   <p>Linda and Bootsie became like mother and daughter but at times fought like sisters but at the end of the day you could tell Linda really loved having a friend who was furry just like her.</p>
