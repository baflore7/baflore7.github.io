   <h2>What my dogs mean to me?</h2>

   <h2>The Generations of Dogs I have had:</h2>
   <h1>Childhood Dogs</h1>
   <p>During my childhood into my teen years, I was not the most social or most popular at school but I knew I had the best of friends at home waiting for me.</p>
   <p>When I was around 9 years old and never had a dog as small as my first Chihuahua that we adopted on Thanksgiving in 2008. She came with the name Linda but had the cutest apple head ever!</p>
   <p>She was a year old at the time but seemed very scared until she became use to my mom and I. However, of course being a little kid who was an outcast at school was ethralled by the fact I had someone who actually wanted to hang out with me, so I ended up asking for another one a year later.</p>
   <p>That is when my mom and I were at the 99 cent store and saw someone selling a litter of white Chihuahuas and they ended up having one girl pup. Therefore, as one little kid does; I started begging for her and of course at some point my mom gave in and we took her home to Linda.</p>
   <p>Linda and Bootsie became like mother and daughter but at times fought like sisters but at the end of the day you could tell Linda really loved having a friend who was furry just like her.</p>
   <p>Lastly came Roxie, she was supposed to spend the night at our house to socialize with Linda and Bootsie. However, my nana ended up simply never asked for her back so we took ownership of her.
While her and Bootise were not the best of friends, mama Linda took her under her wing as her own and became bonded with her as well.</p>

   <p>We had a great 12 years with Linda and Bootsie, with them unfortanately passing about 1 year and 6 days after eachother. Then Roxie and I had a great 13 years together at least that we estimated for all of them due to none of them having an exact birthday to count from.</p>
   <p>They taught me to truly treat my dogs like a human would treat a child but also helped me realize its okay to not always have human connection because animal connection is just as important and beneficial.</p>
   <h1>My 20's children</h1>
   <p>Within the last year with Roxie, my mom and I believed it would help her and perhaps help her live longer if we got her a friend.</p>
   <p>We were crazily mistakened, when we finally found our now pup Rue at 8 Weeks old at a adoption event and brought her home with Roxie. Roxie was like get this thing away from me like a grumpy old girl.</p>
   <p>Luckily after Rue was around 6 months they started to bond and snuggle next to eachother and follow eachother. It was great to see since Roxie was somewhat of the odd child out with Linda and Bootise so we can atleast know she felt some sort of bond before joining the other two.</p> 

   <p>When the unfortanate happened and Roxie passed, Rue was more devasted than we could actually know of at a year and a half. We thought it was simply her being picky and wanting things a certain way like when eating, we had to beg her, sit with her, cover her food in numerous of treats for a good year.</p>
   <p>Eventually, I graduated college and Rue was still on her path of being "picky" as we believed and I figured it was time to get Rue a friend because all she would do is sleep everyday and get up and do the necessary things we asked of her. So she seemed sad in my eyes for the year since Roxie passed.</p>
   <p>So as I did when Bootsie passed for Roxie to find Rue, I began my pup search again but I was fairly picky this time since I REALLY wanted a chihuhua again to fill the whole Roxie left. </p>

   <p>The search was hard due to the changing world and my changing of jobs from in house as a Barista to working at a call center remotely.</p>
   <p>However, after a while and alot of days of searching and interviewing with jobs to get a more flexible job to care for a puppy, I got that job and knew it was time to truly kick up the search for a pup.</p>
   <p>So my mom and I started going to shelters every weekend and checking their websites everyday and night. Eventually around christmas time in 2024 we saw a cute Dauschund that was around 11 weeks old so we decided to go meet her.</p>
   <p>As I went to meet her, I typically am a big softie when I meet puppies so of course we ended up adpoting her as Rue's new friend.</p>
   <p>She had to stay there until she was spayed but we got to pick her up the day before Christmas Eve, so it was Rue's present. </p>
   <p>We truly did not know how Rue would react but to our suprise Rue was so excited and loved her instantly. So we knew we had to keep her and I ended up calling her Ivy after posion Ivy from the Harley Quinn show off of MAX. Since Posion Ivy is a smart women who uses her brains to truly kick some major butt, hahaha.</p>
   <p>Till this day, Rue is happier than previously and scarfs her food down with no questions and genuinely looks happy to have someone like her to talk with and play with aside from her humans around her.</p>
